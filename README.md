## About

This website created by using basic PHP, HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JGraph. The main idea of the site is to see various projects and invest them with valid amounts.
Note: There is no registration page as the database of the project was initially given with valid profiles.

  There is a home page in which users can see projects without logging in. Bootstrap cards and buttons are widely used in the front view and there is a profile page for every project on this page. Users can access and get information about the project by clicking the more info button.  Also, there is a profile which contains information about the user and about his/her project. There is a table on the page that displays the history of investments by users to the owner only.
  After logging in users can see the list of the projects listed with the help of the bootstrap cards. There are certain types of buttons that have their own separate meaning. An owner cannot invest in his/her project. "See details" button is available only for the project owner for his/her project which leads the owner to a new page containing info about the project, a 3D pie plot that shows the invested and remaining part of the fund, a table that containing the history of the investments by users and finally a bar chart which shows top5 most donated users to this project. "Invest"  button is available for every user if they didn't contribute to the project. The invest button leads the user to the new page in which he/she can invest his amount choosing a valid amount of money and a valid date between the start and the end date of the project. After investing user navigates to the main page and the state of the invest button changes to a yellow "Get info"  button. By clicking on this button users can only see the description and a pie chart about the project as they are already contributed. Also, there is a red "Get info" button which means that the project expired. Again, by clicking on this button users can see the info and a pie chart about the project. Finally, there is a bar chart at the bottom of the page which displays info about requested funds and the amount of the investment to the projects.

All the pages of the application are responsive and can be easily opened by any device.

Thanks for the attention.
